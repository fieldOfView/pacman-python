Thank you for your interest in my tribute to everyone's favorite Pac-Man games
of yesteryear! Pacman features 12 colorful levels of varying sizes, bouncing
fruit, A* path-finding ghosts, and, more recently, cross-platform support,
joystick support, and a high score list. This was the first large-scale project
I ever developed in Python, so the source is not the cleanest, but I would love
to have your contributions! Feel free to slice and dice it up however you like
and redistribute it; I just ask that you give me some credit and let me know
about it, so I can enjoy your creation too! Have fun!


Installation
------------

Pac-man requires **Python 2.x or 3.x** (tested on versions 2.6 and 2.7), and the
corresponding version of the Pygame library, freely available online. Make sure
you install the matching (32- or 64-bit) version of Pygame as your Python
installation, and the one compatible with your Python version number.
